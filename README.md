# Mailchimp App Challenge

This challenge accomplishes the task of displaying a list of subscribers (including profile image icon, first and last names, and email), divided into their corresponding lists. When a subscriber is clicked, the user is redirected to a details page, where member information can be updated (including first name, last name, and email address), which will automatically update the preceding list.

Stretch goals met include animating an avatar transition between pages, as well as creating a collapsable header app bar, and writing model classes and interfaces in Kotlin.
